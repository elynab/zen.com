        <p>About Zen</p>
        <p>Zen is based on teachings that are fundamentally about how humans can live in the world.</p>
        <p>In other words, Zen is about habits, ideas and hints for living a happy life. A treasure trove, if you will, of deep yet simple life wisdom.</p>
        <p>Zen teaching is represented by a series of four phrases. Rather than be fixated on the written or spoken word, we should encounter our essential selves as they exist in the here and now.</p>
        <p>Try not to be swayed by the values of others, not to be troubled by unnecessary concerns, but to live an infinitely simple life, stripped of wasteful things.</p>
        <p>This is “Zen style”.</p>
